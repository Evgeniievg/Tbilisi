            </p>
            <p class="oldtown__text">Most of the sights of Tbilisi are gathered in Old Tbilisi and, therefore, it is the main center of tourist attraction.
              This district is distinguished by Abanotubani - still functioning sulfur baths.
              As well as churches and museums, Sharden Street, where popular restaurants, open-air cafes, nightclubs, galleries and more are located.
              Another main charm of old Tbilisi is the architecture - old street vendors, wooden carved houses and balconies.</p>

                Similar information appears in 1735 map composed by Kartli Prince Vakhushti Bagrationi and in 1701
                 records by French botanist Joseph Pitton de Tournefort, who observed that the plants were well-kept in the royal garden.
                  According to historical sources, a royal family owned three different gardens on this territory, which was their favorite place to relax.
